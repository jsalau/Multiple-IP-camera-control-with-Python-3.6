# Multiple-IP-camera-control-with-Python-3.6
This python code was written to control multiple IP camera devices. It was developed and used with 8 AXIS M3046-V on Windows 7 and Window 10. Python 3 .6 + is needed, as f strings are used (https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/). OpenCV for Python and the VAPIX API by axis.com are used.
